# Note-Taker

As a web developer, I am tasked to meet up with potential and exixting clients to listen to their concerns and/or details about a new or already completed project.

I developed this simple note taker to help me take, save and delete notes without using a pen and paper.

Upon clicking the save icon, the note and title is pushed to the back end in form of a JSON object and also the title appears on the side of the page and the note can be populated again by just clicking on the title.

I used the "express" npm package to set up my server and then added some routes to render different html pages with different routes.
